                                <p>Below is the result from our interview pertaining to questionnaire one<br></p>
                                <img src="../img/preg/q1.png" style="width: 80%;"><br>

                                <p>Questions we asked</p>
                                    <p>1. Where and with who do you watch a game?<br>
                                    2. What is your go-to for getting player information?<br>
                                    3. Is this information important during a live game?<br>
                                    4. Do athletes have any influence on your purchases?<br>
                                    5. What process do you go through for purchasing athletic gear?</p><br>

                                    <p>Key Takeaways</p>
                                  <p>
                                    -   Most people went to games for entertainment<br>
                                    -   Everyone uses google<br>
                                    -   Jumbotron is enough information<br>
                                    -   Look up information in rare cases<br>
                                    -   Athletes have little impact on their purchases. Qualities like: price, quality/durability, and athlete popularity played a main role in the purchasing of team gear.</p>

                                <p>Milan and I conducted over eighty interviews in an 8 week period. We started this process by creating a questionnaire that we handed to people within our network. With this questionnaire we were trying to get a sense of how sports fans get their information and where they watch games.<br></p>

                                   Not many people are serious sports fans. Those we talked with become fans for the <u>community element and comradery</u>.</p>

                                <p>Milan and I conducted over eighty interviews in an 8 week period. We started this process by creating a questionnaire that we handed to people within our network.

                                <img src="../img/preg/q3.png" style="width: 60%;"><br>

                                 <p>Questions we asked</p>
                                    <p>1. Who do you think will win? Why?<br>
                                    2. Have you always been a fan? Have you watched every game?<br>
                                    3. Do you wich someone was here who is not here?</p><br>

                                    <p>Key Takeaways</p>
                                    <p>
                                    We changed our tactic and decided to observe the behaviour rather than ask questions. We went to the spaces where we knew sports fans would be. During the World Cup we went to various sports bars venues throughout Manhattan and Brooklyn during certain matches to conduct more interviews. While in these spaces before the game, we would ask simple questions.<br><br>
                                    A feeling of <u>Pre-Game excitement and anticipation</u> was always there before a game. Fans tend to congregate to the same spaces. Park Slope, Brooklyn has bars that are famous for hosting European sports fans. While Columbian soccer fans can be seen in Jackson Heights, Queens. By mapping these patterns of where sports fans go before kick off, we thought it best to utilize the mobile device for our experience.</p>

                                <p>In the end, we created an experience where sports fans can play sports trivia specific to the game they are about to watch. Your profile will show your expertise level associated with certain teams. This expertise level will be determined and constantly changing after every trivia game you participate in.<br><br>

                                You can have a family group that plays against each other. Or you can set you to profile to "searching" meaning that you are looking for a team in your area to play trivia with. A team within your vicinity or in the bar can recruit you to join their team.<br>
